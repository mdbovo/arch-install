# arch-install
Automating the [Arch Linux install process](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide)  

## Limitations / Notes
- This script tries not to go much beyond the Arch Linux installation guide and will leave you with a quite minimal bootable system (no GUI included). For further configuration automation, take a look at [my configuration repo](https://github.com/spfaus/dotfiles).  
- Currently this script is only set up for non-encrypted systems with 3 partitions (EFI, swap, root).  
- GRUB will be installed as the bootloader.  
- NetworkManager will be installed and enabled to be able to connect to the internet after a reboot (```nmtui``` in the terminal for a graphical wifi tool).  
- Sudoers ```Defaults targetpw``` and ```ALL ALL=(ALL) ALL``` will be set.  
- The mirrorlist will be overwritten with the 50 most recently synchronized HTTPS mirrors, sorted by download rate.  
- The [base-devel](https://www.archlinux.org/groups/x86_64/base-devel/) group and git will be installed.  
- The finished installation will be in English (Canada).  
- A user will be created.  

## How do I use this?
1. Set up an installation medium:  
  a) https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide#Acquire_an_installation_image

3. [Verify the boot mode](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide#Verify_the_boot_mode) if you aren't sure it is UEFI  

4. [Connect to the internet](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide#Connect_to_the_internet)
